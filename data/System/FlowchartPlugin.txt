---+!! <nop>%TOPIC%

This plugin allows you to create a flowchart from topic text.

%TOC%

---++ Example

%INCLUDE{"/%WEB%/FlowchartPluginExample"}%
The example above was generated by the content of the topic FlowchartPluginExample

The items of the flowchart are defined in the following way:

<verbatim>
---++ Item of the Flowchart
        * Id: unique_name
        * Type: Question
        * Yes: item_A
        * No: item_B
</verbatim>

A more complete example is available at [[FlowchartPlugin Example]], once the plugin is installed.

---++ Syntax Rules

To create and display the flowchart, use the macro =%<nop>FLOWCHART%= or =%<nop>FLOWCHART{...}%=.

This plugin uses the content of the topic and considers that each level two heading (=---++=) indicate the beginning of the definition of a new item of the flowchart.

To specify the item and the derived action is expected a list of the type  =* Attribute: Value=

|  *Attribute*  |  *Description*  |
| =Type= | Type of the flowchart's item. Default: =Action=. See the valid types in the table below |
| =Id= | Identification for the =Goto=. It needs to validate with =/[_a-zA-Z0-9]*/= |
| =Color= | Color differentiated for the item |
| =Goto= | Indicates so that item it must follow. Default: =Next= |
| =Yes= | The same as =Goto=, but is required for =Type: Question= |
| =No= | The same as =Goto=, but is required for =Type: Question= |
| =Case= | The same as =Goto=, but is required for =Type: Switch= |

The valid types are:

|  *Type*  |  *Description*  |
| =Start= | Indicates the beginning of a flowchart. This must be the first item |
| =Action= | The standard type. It indicates an action |
| =Question= | Opens a fork in the flow. It requires the definition of attributes =Yes= and =No= |
| =Switch= | Opens a fork in a flow with more than just two paths. The attributes =Case= will define the paths |
| =End= | Indicates the end of the flowchart (or part of it) |
| =End-Error= | End for the error case |

To control the beginning and end of of valid headings for the construction of the Flowchart use =%<nop>FLOWCHART_START%= and =%<nop>FLOWCHART_STOP%=.

<strike>If a name is excessively big for the space of the item a line break can be made with =%<nop>FLOWCHART_BR%=. This will not intervene with the text of the page, only in the flowchart.</strike>%BR%
If a name is excessively big for the width of the item, linebreaks will be inserted automatically. The =%<nop>FLOWCHART_BR%= is deprecated and will be ignored.%BR%
If the name is even too big for the item, it will be truncated. Hovering the mouse over the item will make a popup appear, that shows the whole text.

You can changes the appearance of the flowchart by adding the following parameters to the macro:

|  *Parameter*  |  *Description*  |
| =item-w= | Width for the flowchart's items area |
| =item-h= | Height for the flowchart's items |
| =area-w= | Width of the area of the flowchart's items |
| =area-h= | Height of the area of the flowchart's items |
| =percent= | Percentage of the SVG size presented in relation to the standard of the generated SVG |
| =text-size= | Size in pixels of the font text |
| =max-lines= | Number of textlines in an item |
| =max-path= | Number of lines, that may be drawn between items. This must be an odd number. |
| =<strike>tag-style</strike>= | <strike>Style for the =img= tag</strike> |

---+++ Tips

%I% Web bowsers normally make a cache of the web page and images. It is possible that after a change to the flowchart you do not see the image update. If this happens, hold down the &lt;SHIFT&gt; key and click "Reload" in your web browser to clear the cache.

%I% Some flowcharts can become so complex and will be difficult to follow its lines. In this case, you may zoom in using the mousewheel while hovering over the image.%BR%You may also increase the area of items, giving a bigger space between them. _eg:_ =%<nop>FLOWCHART{ area-w="220" area-h="100" }%=

%I% If a flowchart becomes so complex, that you are missing lines from one item to another, increase the number of lines to be drawn between items. _eg:_ =%<nop>FLOWCHART{ max-path="5" }%=

---++ Construction of the Flowchart and Plugin's Working Way

   1 The blocks initialized by a heading level two =---++= are read as definition of item of the Flowchart (in the same way as the Foswiki:Extensions.SlideShowPlugin).
   1 <strike>An SVG is created with this information and is attached to the topic. This SVG file can be accessed by =%<nop>ATTACHURL%/flowchart_%<nop>TOPIC%.svg=.</strike>
   1 <strike>A PNG is generated by [[http://www.imagemagick.org][ImageMagick]] and reduced, so that the image has a good anti-aliasing, that it is not obtained in the direct conversion. The PNG is attached to the topic and can be accessed by =%<nop>ATTACHURL%/flowchart_%<nop>TOPIC%.png= (use this to separate the flowchart's image of the definition topic when it is rendered).</strike>
   1 <strike>A map for the image is created linking the items of the flowchart with the origin of its information, which can contain more information for the implementation. =%<nop>ATTACHURL%/flowchartMapImg_%<nop>TOPIC%.txt= (use to map the image out of the topic where the flowchart was generated)
     %BR% =%<nop>INCLUDE{"%<nop>PUBURL%/Web/FlowchartTopic/flowchartMapImg_FlowchartTopic.txt"}%=
     %BR% =&lt;img src="%<nop>PUBURL%/Web/FlowchartTopic/flowchart_<nop>FlowchartTopic.png" usemap="flowchart_<nop>FlowchartTopic" alt="Flowchart" border="0" />=</strike>
   1 <strike>The content of the map file and one image tag presenting the PNG are placed in the place of macro =%<nop>FLOWCHART%=.</strike>

<strike>The files (SVG, PNG and Map) are generated when the topic contend =%<nop>FLOWCHART%= is saved.</strike>%BR%
The Flowchart is created on the fly by JavaScript. There are no longer any files that can be downloaded. Modern browsers are able, to render SVG within a HTML document without any plugins, so no external programs are needed to create image files.

---++ Plugin Settings

Plugin settings are stored as preferences variables. To reference a plugin setting write ==%<nop>&lt;plugin&gt;_&lt;setting&gt;%==, i.e. ==%<nop>FLOWCHARTPLUGIN_ITEM_WIDTH%==

To override the default settings, add them to [[%LOCALSITEPREFS%]].

   * Default width for the flowchart's items
      * Set ITEM_WIDTH = 140
   * Default height for the flowchart's items
      * Set ITEM_HEIGHT = 40
   * Default width for the area of the flowchart's items
      * Set ITEM_AREA_W = 180
   * Default height of the area of the flowchart's items
      * Set ITEM_AREA_H = 70
   * Default size in pixels of the font text
      * Set TEXT_SIZE = 10
   * <strike>Default percentage of the PNG size presented in relation to the standard of the generated SVG</strike>
      * <strike>Set PERCENT_IMG = 70</strike>
   * <strike>Default style for the =img= tag</strike>
      * <strike>Set TAG_STYLE = border:1px dotted #505050;</strike>
   * Default number of textlines in an item
      * Set MAX_LINES = 3
   * Default number of connection paths between items
      * Set MAX_PATH = 3

   * One line description, is shown in the %SYSTEMWEB%.TextFormattingRules topic:
      * Set SHORTDESCRIPTION = Create a flowchart from topic text

---++ Plugin Installation Instructions

You do not need to install anything in modern browsers to use this extension.
Older browsers, that do not yet support inline SVG, need an SVG-Plugin, if available.%BR%
The following instructions are for the administrator who installs the extension on the server.

Open configure, and open the "Extensions" section. Use "Find More Extensions" to get a list of available extensions. Select "Install".

If you have any problems, or if the extension isn't available in =configure=, then you can still install manually from the command-line. See http://foswiki.org/Support/ManuallyInstallingExtensions for more help.
